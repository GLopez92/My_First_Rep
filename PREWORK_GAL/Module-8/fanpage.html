		<h2>BIO</h2>
		<p>
			 Sublime was an American ska punk band from Long Beach, California, made in 1988.
		</p>
		<p> Sublime released three studio albums, one live album, five compilation albums, three EPs and one box set. Although their first two albums 40oz. to Freedom and Robbin' the Hood were quite popular in the United States, Sublime did not experience major marketable success until 1996 with their self-titled third album, released two months after Nowell's death, which peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard 200, and produced the single "What I Got", which remains the band's only No. 1 hit single.
